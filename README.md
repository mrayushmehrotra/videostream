## Video Streaming

A minimalistic video streaming backend for microservices.
User have to just put the video file in video folder
automatically that route has been generated for you.
now you can hit that route in frontend and render the video.

## EXAMPLE

i have a video file vid.mp4 i just pasted that video inside the video folder,
My link would be localhost:/video.mp4
